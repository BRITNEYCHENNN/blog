IF TODAY IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: Intense, well-directed and hard-driving, your brilliant and thorough work survives well after your own lifetime. This year, the pandemic teaches you to be less obsessive, and you succeed in a different field. If single, your sense of humour attracts a special someone after mid-year. If attached, your very private bond only intensifies. You can be difficult to live with, and you correct that this year. PISCES likes to retreat too.

ARIES (March 21-April 19)

Love connections are a source of healing and encouragement today. Control impatience and irritability. Don't overwhelm timid individuals. It's a good idea to assume a leadership role and try all that is new and fresh. Tonight: Speak (remotely) to a group.

TAURUS (April 20-May 20)

Today gifts you with quick wit. Decisions made today will be wise ones. Much is expected of you. It's time to get organized. Separate family needs from career responsibilities. A new challenge appeals to you. Tonight: Honour an important invitation that involves many others.
